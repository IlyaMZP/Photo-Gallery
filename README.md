Photo Gallery

A simple, responsive photo gallery with jQuery on the front-end and Flask framework on the back-end. All HTML, CSS and icons handcoded. Also comes in two theme styles that you can toggle at the bottom of the page.

Modify flaskr/app.cfg to set different administrator account credentials and secret_key.

Install dependencies and run as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
flask run
```

Go to 127.0.0.1:5000/upload_images to get into admin dashboard.
